## Introduction

One of the most important aspects of a website is its images. Images can now become more interactive with the use of CSS transitions and animations. So, in this tutorial, we'll learn how to make images more interactive using the Tailwind CSS.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes. Tailwind CSS does not come with components, unlike other CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Chakra UI. Tailwind CSS, on the other hand, works by giving you a set of classes. With these classes, you can quickly create your own designs.

For example, I'll make a button with a pink background, white text, medium font weight, horizontal padding-7, vertical padding-3, and rounded full.

```jsx
<button class='rounded-full bg-pink-600 px-7 py-3 font-medium text-white'>
  Click me!
</button>
```

It can be seen that Tailwind CSS can create custom buttons based on our preferences by only giving a set of classes.

  alt='Button'

  height='270'
/>

## Getting Started

to create a typescript project we can create with create-next-app using the --ts, --typescript flags like this:

```bash
$ npx create-next-app@latest --ts
# or
$ yarn create next-app --typescript
# or
$ pnpm create next-app -- --ts
```

After the project is created, we will move to the tailwind installation.

```bash
$ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
$ npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Add the paths to all of your template files in `tailwind.config.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Add the @tailwind directives to `./styles/globals.css` file.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

After all we can start running project with:

```bash
$ npm run dev
#or
$ yarn dev
```
