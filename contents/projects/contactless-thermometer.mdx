## Objective

The objective and hope for the development of this tool is to check body temperature without using operator.

## Role and Scope

My role is a programmer who handles the microcontroller and the coding. There's not much I can do other than that because my realm is not in electronics.

## How it Works

the thermometer is mounted on the wall, and the visitor wants to enter the room, the visitor must put his hand on the sensor. If the temperature exceeds 37 degrees, a notification will appear on the screen.

## Implementation

In this project I used the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/). I also use gy906 sensor to check human body temperature.

To make this project detect movement of the hand, I used the ultrasonic sensor.

## Lessons Learned

I'm learning a lot about cable wiring and how to use it. I'm also learning how to code on Arduino.
