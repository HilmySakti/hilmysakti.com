## Background

During a pandemic, thermometers are needed a lot. All public places, especially government offices, must have one operator who checks the temperature of visitors.

When doing kuliah kerja nyata (KKN), we had the idea of making a thermometer without an operator for the government office using a microcontroller.

How does it works? thermometer is mounted on the wall, and the visitor wants to enter the room, the visitor must put his hand on the sensor. If the temperature exceeds 37 degrees, a notification will appear on the screen.

- buzzer fc 07
- ultrasonic hc-sr04
- breadboard
- arduino r3
- lcd arduino 16x2
