## Objective

The objective and hope for the development of this app is:

1. Clients can add data to this website easily.
2. Promoting programs owned by the Panca Olah Institute.
3. Promoting courses owned by the Panca Olah Institute.
4. Clients can post blogs with categories of articles, tips, and news.

## Role and Scope

My role is front-end developer who is responsible for the design and development of the website.

## Implementation

Honestly, I don't have any skills in web development. I just started to learn React 3 months ago while creating the [jagad.xyz](https://jagad.xyz) (now [jagad.dev](https://jagad.dev)). After I learned all the stuff about web development, I decided to accept offers from my friend to create [pancaolah.com](https://pancaolah.com).

Kebonsari.site is a website using Next.js and the Tailwind CSS framework. The reason for using next.js is for server side rendering.

I also use contentful to manage the content of the website. Contentful is a CMS that is easy to use and it is very popular.

## Lessons Learned

I'm learning a lot about website development. In this project, I learned how to use contentful to manage the content of the website. I also learned how to handle pagination and how to use the SEO features of the website.
