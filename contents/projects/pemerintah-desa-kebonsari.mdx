## Objective

The objective and hope for the development of this app is:

1. showing that Kebonsari is a modern village that is constantly modernizing its system.
2. increasing people's knowledge of Kebonsari.
3. provide information about Kebonsari
4. showing the original MSMEs (UMKM) of Kebonsari

## Role and Scope

My role is front-end developer who is responsible for the design and development of the website.

## Design

Design is the stage in which we provide a complete picture of what needs to be done and how we want the system to look. At this stage, I use Figma to design the website.

## Implementation

Kebonsari.site is a website using Next.js and the Tailwind CSS framework. The reason for using next.js is that it is a framework that is used to create a static website.

## Lessons Learned

I'm learning a lot about website development. I learned that the website must be responsive, and that it must be seen on a variety of devices.
