## Background

At the beginning of 2020, the world was shocked by a new pneumonia outbreak that originated in China and then spread rapidly throughout the world. In Indonesia, the government is trying to educate the public about the coronavirus, but it's still not optimal because some people don't understand how to access websites from their phone browsers.

The Telegram bot is the solution to the problems that have been mentioned above, because users can type the provinces where they live and the telegram bot will reply to the message with coronavirus data in that province.

## Results

The user enters the name of a province and the bot will display COVID-19 data for the province that the user entered before.
